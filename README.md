# house-pricing-prediction-automl
## introduction
### task
- implement a house pricing prediction task using two automl library
### automl
- Automated machine learning, also referred to as automated ML or AutoML, is the process of automating the time-consuming, iterative tasks of machine learning model development. It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality. 
### ludwig
- [Ludwig](https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/0.5/) is an open-source, declarative machine learning framework that makes it easy to define deep learning pipelines with a simple and flexible data-driven configuration system. Ludwig is suitable for a wide variety of AI tasks, and is hosted by the Linux Foundation AI & Data.
### flaml
- [FLAML](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML) is a lightweight Python library that finds accurate machine learning models automatically, efficiently and economically. It frees users from selecting learners and hyperparameters for each learner.
